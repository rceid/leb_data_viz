# leb_data_viz
### A dynamic visualization web app

This web app was created for the course CAPP 30239
Data Visualization for Policy Analysis. It is my attempt at telling the story of the economic crisis in Lebanon using data visualization. Project can be found on the following link:
rceid.github.io/leb_data_viz/

The directory static_project contains raw data sources and cleaning files that comprise the final, polish datasets used in this project.

All other files and directories are solely dedicated to the web app.

- Special thanks to Andrew McNutt for his instructional videos and guidance on animating my line chart.
